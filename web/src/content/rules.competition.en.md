## 1. Eligibility and teams

1. Participation is open worldwide to individuals and teams. One account per person.
2. A team has 1 to 3 members. A person belongs to at most one team. Submissions are made on behalf of a team.
3. Organizers, evaluation-platform maintainers, and their immediate collaborators are excluded from awards. Their teams are marked hidden on the boards.
4. Team names and content must follow the code of conduct (section 8).

## 2. Schedule

All participants use the same Participate page; the platform selects the active competition.

| Stage | Time (UTC+8) | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Competition | Oct 5 00:00 – Oct 7 23:59 | Submit and evaluate projects; the board updates live |
| Verification and results | After the competition | Organizers verify the top teams, then publish the final standings |
| Awards Day | Oct 17 | GOSIM Shenzhen |

## 3. What you submit

1. Submit a complete project from a public GitHub repository or a private ZIP up to 50 MB. Any language is allowed. Review and confirm the fixed source revision, launch settings and proposed adapter after the platform checks them.
2. Formal competition accepts complete projects only. CSV files and local CSV sessions are not accepted.
3. Each evaluation receives current observations one round at a time. The server records each decision before releasing the next observation. Future weather and hidden anomaly answers remain private.
4. Every team has the same daily quota of complete batches, shown on the page. Every batch covers all configured scenarios.

## 4. Execution and model APIs

1. Python is the platform runner, not a language restriction. The confirmed project runs in its specified container.
2. Model calls are optional. Participants provide their own API and quota; organizer model credits are not provided. Keys are submitted over HTTPS, stored encrypted on the server, used only for evaluation and verification, and never written to projects, run records or logs. They are deleted once the results have been verified. Do not place keys in project sources.
3. External compute and external services are allowed, including your own model APIs and servers. The platform container limits (2 CPU cores, 2 GB memory) apply only to the part that runs on the platform.
4. Every decision must be made automatically by your program. Human participation in, or substitution for, decisions is prohibited.
5. External services must stay available during evaluation and verification. Results affected by external outages, timeouts or rate limits are scored as they occur and are not re-run.
6. Attempts to read other teams' data, tamper with scoring or deliberately exhaust platform resources can lead to disqualification.

For model calls, enter a supported HTTPS endpoint, model and key in Participate and save them; the page does not need to stay open during evaluation. You can replace or delete a saved key at any time.

## 5. Scoring

The score is computed by the published `scoring_core.py` (schema `challenge-score-v3`) with the constants in `config/score_config.json`. In summary:

1. Time is a calendar of 900-second slots over real nights. `observe` runs from the cursor for the tile's `nominal_exptime_seconds`, may cross slots and is split into segments; `wait` consumes the rest of the current slot.
2. For each segment of a **completed** exposure, at the segment midpoint:
   `A = min(instrument_efficiency · transparency · sky_quality / (seeing_arcsec · airmass), 3.0)`, `combined = A · lunar_quality_factor`,
   `base = V_tile · (segment_seconds / nominal_exptime_seconds) · combined`, where `V_tile` is the sum of `science_weight` over the tile's targets;
   `bonus = base · B[program]` with `B = {DARK 0.25, BRIGHT 0.15, BACKUP 0.08}`, paid only when the decision program equals the band implied by `combined` (DARK ≥ 0.65, BRIGHT ≥ 0.40, else BACKUP).
3. `total = base_science + program_bonus + request_reward + report_reward + coverage_bonus − unsafe_observation − invalid_action − avoidable_wait − required_miss − flexible_shortfall − request_miss − fault_misreport − wrong_tag_report`, with 2000 per unsafe observation (observing into a closed dome), 100 per invalid action (unknown tile/slot/program, outside the availability window, bad request tag, exposure that cannot finish before the tile sets or the night ends, stale decision), 0.001 per avoidable waiting second, 1000 per uncompleted REQUIRED tile, 100 per FLEXIBLE tile below the quota of 4 per region, and 190 per required tile of an expired request (140 rewarded per required tile when completed).
4. **Repeat observations and anomaly reports**: re-observation is legal — a tile banks the maximum over its observations (a worse repeat never lowers it), and completion still banks on the first legal observation. Scenarios hide per-tile tags (nova ×1.5, reddening ×0.8, applied silently by the scorer) and region-scoped instrument faults (a sharp efficiency collapse that is never forecast). A `decision_response` may carry a `reports` array: tag reports settle at final scoring, first report per (tile, tag), +100 correct / −150 wrong; a correct fault report publishes the fault status one simulated day later and completes the repair after two, while a misreport gets one free allowance per correct report and costs 100 each beyond it. See the `reporting` / `anomaly_tags` / `fault_response` sections of `score_config.json`.
5. **Coverage evenness** (`coverage_bonus`): `coverage_bonus = W · base_science · E`, where `E` is how evenly the finished tiles are spread over the regions (Jain's fairness index, `(Σx)² / (n·Σx²)`: 1.0 when all eight regions get the same number, 1/8 when one region takes everything). The weight `W` lives in each scenario's `config/score_config.json`: **0.35 for the current competition scenarios**. A wide survey needs even coverage to support its statistics, so crowding the easy regions now costs something.
6. Only completed exposures score. An exposure interrupted by closed weather earns nothing and is not penalised; an exposure interrupted by geometry or the end of the night earns nothing and is an invalid action.
7. Terminal penalties are applied to every run, including runs cut short by the wall clock or an agent error. An expired request with fewer feasible opportunities than required tiles is excused.
8. Completion (completed tiles ÷ tiles) and the FLEXIBLE shortfall per region are reported on the board; they are part of the score through the terminal penalties.
9. Each competition batch covers every competition scenario. Its score is the arithmetic mean of all scenario scores from that batch; it ranks only when all scenarios are complete. Each team keeps its best complete batch, without combining scenario maxima from different batches.
10. **Random scenarios and sequential decisions.** In the current competition, each team and evaluation attempt receives a different private seed for weather, events and hidden tags. Public observation tasks and scoring rules stay fixed. The platform records each decision before releasing the next observation; future rounds cannot be submitted early and accepted decisions cannot be replaced. An infrastructure retry of the same run retains its scenario; a new evaluation attempt receives a new one.
11. **Difficulty calibration.** Three fixed online reference policies test each generated scenario against bounds frozen in advance; outliers are not served to participants. The ranking score is `10000 × (raw score − all-wait score) / (reference-policy mean − all-wait score)`: all-wait scores 0, the reference mean scores 10000, and stronger policies can exceed 10000. Raw totals and components remain visible. Item 9 averages the calibrated scores. Calibration reduces scenario differences without guaranteeing equal difficulty for every possible strategy. Before activation, organizers validate independent samples and freeze the generator, calibration rules and scenario configuration. Private records support regeneration and score audits. Existing scores are preserved.

## 6. Ranking, ties, and verification

1. Only scored, non-excluded submissions count, combined as in section 5, item 9. Ranking is by score, descending; on an exact tie the earlier submission ranks first.
2. The Online Competition board is live. Organizers may freeze the board during the final hours and publish the final standings after verification.
3. Before awards are confirmed, organizers verify the top teams by re-running their ranked version on new hidden scenarios, and may ask for the complete code, the versions and configuration of the external services and models used, and the call records from evaluation. Keep those external services and your saved key available until verification ends. Results that cannot run, that are clearly inconsistent with the ranked score, or that involved human intervention are removed.
4. Organizers may re-score submissions if a scorer defect is found. Any change to the scorer or the constants is announced with a version number and applies to every submission of the phase. The current constants are provisional organizer calibration values until the online competition opens.

## 7. Awards

| Award | Prize | Count |
|---|---|---|
| First Prize | $2,000 | 1 |
| Second Prize | $1,000 | 2 |
| Third Prize | $500 | 3 |

Amounts are gross. Winning teams are invited to Awards Day at GOSIM Shenzhen on October 17, 2026; attendance is not required to receive a prize.

Design evaluation is separate from the performance board. It considers code, run
records and reproducibility, not explanation length. Participants can save
architecture and reproduction notes on the Participate page. Design-award places and
prizes will be announced separately.

## 8. Code of conduct

1. Be respectful. Harassment, discrimination, and abusive content in team names, notes, or agent output are not tolerated.
2. Do not share accounts, do not submit another team's work, and do not create multiple teams to multiply the daily limit.
3. Report platform defects to the organizers instead of exploiting them. Reports of scorer or sandbox issues are welcome and credited.
4. Decisions of the organizers on eligibility, disqualification, and awards are final.

## 9. Data and privacy

1. Registration data (name, email, affiliation, GitHub handle) is used only to run the event and to contact winners.
2. Private ZIP projects, results, run records and score reports are visible only to the submitting team and organizers and are retained until 90 days after Awards Day. Forks of public repositories remain public; use ZIP for private projects. Model keys never enter project repositories or frontend code.
3. Team names, scores, and ranks are public.
