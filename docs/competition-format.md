# Competition format: what the platform implements

This records the decision the science team asked for ("我们决定的比赛方式会影响后续接口的设计，所以需要大家敲定最终版本")
and points at the code that implements it. Both formats that were on the table are supported; they are used in
different phases rather than one replacing the other.

## The decision

| | Practice phase | Online competition phase |
|---|---|---|
| Submission | `decisions.csv` (results file) only | `decisions.csv` (results file) only — agent packages are no longer accepted (2026-09-24) |
| Weather | published in full, including `weather_events.csv` | weather, forecasts and events published automatically when the phase opens; `tile_anomalies.csv` stays hidden |
| Who runs the survey | the participant, locally | the participant, locally |
| Scenarios | `demo-week` (7 nights), `dev-fortnight` (14), `dev-reference` (180) | `eval-a`, `eval-b` (30 nights, 8 regions × 200 tiles each) |
| Daily limit per team | 50 | 10 |
| Counts for awards | no | yes, mean over both scenarios |

The online-phase scenarios are generated at 8 regions × 200 tiles over the same 30 nights, with
`coverage_bonus_weight` 0.35. Demand against available observing time is ~142% (eval-a) and ~137% (eval-b), so
finishing everything is impossible by construction and the coverage term makes what gets skipped matter.

Rationale, in the terms the original discussion used:

- The **results-file** route is the one that works when the weather CSV is public. The participant replays the
  weather with the shipped simulators, produces a decision sequence and the scorer grades it. Local and platform
  scores are byte-identical, so this is the fastest feedback loop and the easiest to debug. It is kept for practice.
- The **hosted-agent** route is the answer to the fairness concern. If a participant holds the whole weather
  sequence, a global optimiser beats any honest online policy. On hidden scenarios the platform starts the agent
  itself and gives it only the snapshot for the current slot, so future weather is unavailable by construction.
  It is the only route for the phase that decides the awards.

Keeping both costs nothing in interface terms: they meet at `decisions.csv`. The hosted run produces exactly the
file a participant would have uploaded, and the same scorer grades both.

## The coverage term

A score that only adds up per-tile science is indifferent to where the tiles come from: once scarcity forces an
agent to skip work, it can abandon whole regions for free. `challenge-score-v3` therefore gained one additive term:

```
coverage_bonus = coverage_bonus_weight × base_science_score × coverage_evenness
```

`coverage_evenness` is Jain's fairness index over the per-region counts of completed tiles — 1.0 when finished
tiles spread evenly across the eight regions, 1/8 when one region took everything, 0 when nothing was observed.
The weight lives in each scenario's `score_config.json` and defaults to 0, so scenarios that never set it are
unaffected by the term. Only `eval-a` and `eval-b` set it, at 0.35 — there the term is worth roughly a fifth of
a competitive run's total, and measured strategy differences reach ~2% of total, twenty times the ±0.1% spread
the challenge produced without it.

## The anomaly release (protocol v2 / snapshot v3 / weather v2)

The mechanics are **per scenario**, gated by the anomaly sections of `score_config.json`: the
online-competition scenarios (and the kit's `finals-preview`) enable them, while every practice scenario
keeps the pre-anomaly contract byte for byte — same snapshots, same scores, and previously uploaded v1
agent packages keep running there unchanged. On the enabled scenarios the contract adds the
anomaly-detection game on top of the survey:

- **Efficiency jitter + instrument faults.** Baseline `instrument_efficiency` is drawn per slot in [0.90, 1.00]
  and frozen at generation. One `instrument_fault` event per scenario (region-scoped, efficiency multiplier down
  to 0.10) starts mid-survey and has no natural lifetime (`persists_until_survey_end`): it ends only when a
  correct agent report completes the repair clock. Faults are never forecast and never appear in agent
  snapshots; they only act on the scorer's effective weather.
- **Hidden tile tags.** `outputs/reference/tile_anomalies.csv` (generated from `tile_config.json`
  `anomaly_tags` counts) marks tiles `nova` (score ×1.5) or `reddening` (×0.8, stacking). The multipliers are
  published in `score_config.json`; the tagged tiles are hidden from snapshots only — the truth file ships with
  practice scenarios and stays auditable.
- **Realized-score feedback.** Every snapshot carries `tile_last_finished: {tile_id, score} | null` — the
  realized official score of the most recently finished exposure (interrupted exposures report 0). Snapshot
  weather never carries `instrument_efficiency` and the preview baseline is efficiency-free, so comparing the
  two isolates the hidden instrument side (jitter × fault multiplier × tag multiplier).
- **Report channel.** `decision_response` accepts an optional `reports` array (`Instrument_Failure`, or
  `NOVA` / `Reddening` with a `tile_id`). Reports cost no slot time. Malformed entries are dropped without
  killing the action; duplicates are tolerated. Tags settle at final scoring: first report per (tile, tag),
  +100 correct / −150 wrong (`reporting` section of `score_config.json`). Fault reports drive an in-run
  lifecycle: a correct report (an unacknowledged fault active) publishes `fault_status` after
  `fault_response.response_latency_days` (1 d) at night starts and completes the repair after
  `repair_duration_days` (2 d), which truncates the fault's multiplier; a report with no active fault is a
  misreport — one free per correct report (`fault_misreport_free_allowance`), then `fault_misreport_penalty`
  (100) each, counter resetting on every correct report; re-reporting an acknowledged fault under repair is
  neutral. Misreports get a one-night `"status":"normal"` answer on the same latency schedule.
- **Repeat observations.** `duplicate_tile` is gone: re-observation is legal and a tile's science score is the
  maximum over its observations; completion, REQUIRED-miss relief and flexible quotas still bank on the first
  legal observation; request visits decouple from tile scores (a request on a previously observed tile needs a
  new post-issue observation to count a visit). `avoidable_wait` counts a wait as avoidable when an unfinished
  tile could complete or a repeat could beat the tile's banked best.
- **Audit chain.** Accepted reports are flattened into `decisions.csv` as `report_instrument_failure` /
  `report_nova` / `report_reddening` action rows (sharing the incrementing `decision_id` sequence), so the
  single trace file replays everything and its SHA-256 covers reports too. The baseline anchor is
  `23430.568406` (test constant, starter-kit README, SKILL.md).

Calibration knobs: `score_config.json` sections `repeat_observation` / `reporting` / `anomaly_tags` /
`fault_response`; `weather_config.json` `quality.instrument_efficiency.jitter_minimum/maximum` and
`events.instrument_fault` (including its `instrument_efficiency_multiplier_range`); `tile_config.json` `anomaly_tags`; the reference agent's detection thresholds are
the `SAC_ANOMALY_*` environment variables documented in `agent/anomaly_detection.py`.

## Where each piece lives

| Concern | Code |
|---|---|
| Submission kind (`results` \| `agent`) | `public.submission_kind` enum, `supabase/migrations/20260909000100_core.sql` |
| Which kinds a phase accepts | `phases.allow_results` / `phases.allow_agents`, enforced in the `create_submission` RPC |
| Which scenarios a phase uses | `phase_scenarios`, seeded in `worker/main.py` (`DEFAULT_SCENARIOS`, `seed()`) |
| Per-file visibility of a scenario | `scenarios.weather_public` / `forecasts_public` / `events_public`; enforced when the scenario is published to storage |
| Results-file evaluation | `worker/main.py` `evaluate()`, `kind == "results"` branch: the upload becomes `decisions.csv` and goes straight to the scorer |
| Hosted agent run | `worker/challenge_runner.py` via `evaluate()`, `kind == "agent"`: per-run venv, scrubbed environment, rlimits, one global wall clock, process-group kill at the cutoff |
| Agent transport | `challenge/run_challenge.py` (`JsonLineAgentProcess`), protocol `participant-agent-protocol-v2` |
| Scoring | `challenge/scoring_core.py`, the science team's scorer plus one additive coverage-uniformity term (off by default); weights in `scoring/score_config.json` |
| Replay visualization | `challenge/replay.py` + `challenge/templates/decision_replay.html`; produced for both kinds and uploaded as `decision_replay.html` |
| Local equivalent of the hosted run | `starter_kit/local_runner.py` — same transport, same environment rules, same scorer |

## Scenario generation

All scenarios come from one generator, `challenge/scenario_builder.py`, driven by the tile, weather, calendar and
request simulators delivered by the science team. A scenario is a directory of `config/*.json` plus
`outputs/reference/*.csv`, checksummed and validated by the authoritative scorer before it is registered.

```bash
# public practice scenario, everything downloadable
python -m worker.main gen-scenario --slug demo-week --seed 20261005 --days 7 --start-date 2026-10-05 --wallclock 900

# competition scenario, weather and forecasts withheld
python -m worker.main gen-scenario --slug eval-c --seed 777 --days 30 --start-date 2026-10-05 --wallclock 3600 \
  --hidden-weather --hidden-forecasts --regions 8 --tiles-per-region 200 --coverage-weight 0.35
```

The `demo-week` parameters above are the same ones that produced `starter_kit/scenarios/demo-week`, so the copy in
the downloaded kit and the copy the platform publishes are the same scenario.

## Open operational items

These are decisions for the organizers, not code changes:

- Rotate the seeds of `eval-a` / `eval-b` before the online phase. The seeds and the generator are public, so any
  scenario whose parameters have been published can be rebuilt locally — hidden weather is only hidden while the
  parameters are. A rotation reads catalogue size and coverage weight off the published scenario, so it changes
  the weather and nothing else; the reference defaults (64 tiles, no coverage term) only apply when a scenario's
  config cannot be read back. Rotation also redraws the hidden `tile_anomalies.csv` tags and the
  `instrument_fault` events, since both derive from the scenario seed.
- Practice-phase `results` uploads are a bare `decisions.csv` — which now also carries any `report_*` rows, so
  practice scoring settles reports exactly like hosted runs.
- Decide how many worker runners to keep alive during the online phase. A 1–2 h wall clock per scenario means one
  runner serialises submissions.
